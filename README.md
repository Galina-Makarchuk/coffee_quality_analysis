# Coffee Quality Analysis

From beans to scores: features driving coffee ratings.
---
__About the project:__
The project investigates how metadata (origin, altitude, processing, etc.) and sensory attributes (aroma, flavor, acidity, balance, etc.) influence the overall coffee quality score (total cup points).

__Analytical methods:__
* correlation matrix
* exploratory data analysis (EDA)
* Time Series analysis
* Machine learning (ML): Random Forest model
* Explainable AI: SHAP model interpretation

__Project goal:__ \
Predict and explain coffee cup score from cupping attributes and metadata.

__Data source:__ \
Kaggle Coffee Quality Database from CQI: \
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/volpatto/coffee-quality-database-from-cqi

__Project tasks:__
* Explore ... through ... and Python.
* Analyze .
* Visualize .
* Perform ... analysis.
* Explore relationship between altitude and cup quality.
* Built the full altitude-cleaning and analysis pipeline.
* A predictive model (regression) to estimate score.
* Use regression or classification to find key predictors (e.g., aroma, acidity, roast type).
* Build feature importance visualizations.
* Quantifying and visualizing the influence of coffee characteristics on total cup points.
* Feature analysis of coffee sensory attributes and their impact on quality scores.
